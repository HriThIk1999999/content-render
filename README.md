Content-Based Article Recommendation System

This project is a content-based article recommendation system that provides relevant articles based on user queries. It uses LLAMA-INDEX, RAG, and LangChain, leveraging the Llama 2 model for language generation and the Mini/Sentence-Transformers model for embeddings.

Features

Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests articles based on user queries.

LLM-Powered: Utilizes Llama 2 for natural language understanding and response generation.

Embeddings: Uses Mini/Sentence-Transformers for efficient and accurate embeddings.

API Integration: Exposes the recommendation functionality via a Flask API.

Prerequisites

Python (>=3.8)

Libraries listed in requirements.txt

Git (optional for cloning the repository)

Google Colab or a local development environment (e.g., VS Code).

Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project on Google Colab

Open your Google Colab environment.

Clone the repository into the Colab notebook:

!git clone <repository-url>
%cd <repository-directory>

Install the dependencies:

!pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask app using ngrok:

from flask_ngrok import run_with_ngrok
from app.main import app

run_with_ngrok(app)
app.run()

A public URL will be generated by ngrok (e.g., https://<random-id>.ngrok.io). Use this URL to test the API.

Running the Project Locally

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.

Activate the virtual environment (if created).

Install dependencies from requirements.txt.

Run the Flask app:

python app/main.py

Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

API Endpoints

GET /recommend

Description: Returns recommended articles based on the user query.

Query Parameters:

query (string): User's search query.

Example Request:

curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommend?query=technology"

Response:

{
    "query": "technology",
    "recommendations": [
        "Article 1: Advances in AI",
        "Article 2: The Future of Tech",
        "Article 3: Emerging Innovations"
    ]
}

Deploying the Project on Render

Sign Up/Log In to Render.

Create a New Web Service:

Link your GitHub repository.

Set the Build Command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set the Start Command:

python app/main.py

Deploy the Service.

Use the provided URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.onrender.com) to access the app.

Testing the API

Local Testing:

Use curl, Postman, or a browser to test the endpoints (e.g., /recommend).

Deployed Testing:

Replace http://127.0.0.1:5000 with your Render URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.onrender.com).

Example:

curl "https://your-app-name.onrender.com/recommend?query=science"

Notes

ngrok: Used only for testing on Google Colab.

Render: Preferred for deployment to ensure public accessibility.
